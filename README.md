## Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an exercise to practice HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. 

Using the structure and rules of the classic game known as Tic-Tac-Toe, this is a version themed after television show The Vampire Diaries. The characters Stefan and Damon Salvatore represent the X's and O's: an image of Damon Salvatore represents the O's and an image of Stefan Salavatore represents the X's.
